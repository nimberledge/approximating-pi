#Archimedes' Approximation of Pi

A graphical demonstration of Archimedes' approximation of Pi, which I believe to be the earliest attempt to obtain a value. The method is to have an inscribing and circumscribing regular N-gon to the circle. As N increases, each N-gon's area grows closer to Pi.

This is intuitive enough, as a circle is the limit as N tends to infinity of N-gons. The reason this could actually be used to approximate Pi was because we can easily calculate the area of a given N-gon so long as we know its side-length. We simply split the N-gon into triangles, and do some boring trigonometry to get the area of 1 triangle, and multiply that by N.

Understandably, this approximation does not converge too quick, but making graphics for it posed some mildly intriguing questions to me about how to obtain the points of the N-gons in 2-D space.

If I have added a screenshot or gif of the program here (as there should be), then future me has remembered that I even started this project. Ciao
